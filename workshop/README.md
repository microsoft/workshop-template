## Pre-Learning

- [Overview of Containers and Docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/containerized-lifecycle/introduction-to-containers-and-docker?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella)
- [Introduction to Git](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-git/?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella)
- [Use a Docker container as a development environment with Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/use-docker-container-dev-env-vs-code/?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella)

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## What students will learn

Say you're working on a hackathon project with your classmates using Python, and you want to make sure that your project is compatible across multiple machines. In this workshop, you will learn how you can use development containers to work on any project without having to set up or configure your machine first.

## Prepare the project

In this section, you'll do some setup to [open a sample project](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/use-docker-container-dev-env-vs-code/2-exercise-prepare-project?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella) written in Python, and install the Remote Containers extension for Visual Studio Code. 

## Use the Remote - Containers extension

Next, you'll learn how to [use the Remote - Containers extension in Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/use-docker-container-dev-env-vs-code/3-use-as-development-environment?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella). You'll be able to understand how Docker and Visual Studio Code make it possible to have projects contained in their own preconfigured, containerized environments using the extension. 

## Add a dev container to an existing project

Now that you have the extension ready to go, you'll [add a dev container and open the sample project](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/use-docker-container-dev-env-vs-code/4-exercise-add-development-container?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella) in the container. 

## Customize project and editor settings

After setting up the dev container for the project, you'll learn how to [customize and automate all the project setup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/use-docker-container-dev-env-vs-code/5-customize-settings?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella) using the devcontainer.json file.
