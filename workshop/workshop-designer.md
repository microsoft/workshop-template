# UBD: Understanding By Design

The UBD technique of curriculum design was created by Jay McTighe and Grant Wiggins and outlined in their book, "[Understanding By Design](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Design-second-Grant-Wiggins/dp/B006NPF8D0/ref=sr_1_15?crid=26FTBZ6E9Q53K&keywords=understanding+by+design&qid=1636052567&sprefix=understanding+by+design%2Caps%2C94&sr=8-15)". UBD is a process of "backwards design" where the curriculum designer works through three stages, starting with the desired goals of the learning experience and moving backwards through assessments and then to the lesson design. It bears some similarities to TDD (test-driven development) processes in Engineering, where tests are to be written before the code. Use this template to outline your workshop's desired outcomes.

## Workshop Title
Getting Started with Development Containers in VS Code

## Workshop Source

[Use a Docker container as a development environment with Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/use-docker-container-dev-env-vs-code/?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella)

## Stage 1: Desired Results 

> List your established goals of the workshop experience here. These are the takeaways that you want students to have after completing the workshop.

1. Students will be skilled at:
- Installing extensions in VS Code
- Loading and connecting to a project in a Docker container
- Accessing ports in the container from their local machine
- Customizing settings for a container
- Adding software to a container
1. Students will be able to independently use their learning to:
- Set up their own Docker container with customized settings and software
- Connect to their remote container using Docker 

## Stage 2: Evidence

> List any evaluative criteria and Assessment Evidence. Students will demonstrate their understanding of the concepts by doing the following:
 
1. Performance Tasks (these are tasks that a student can complete to demonstrate comprehension, such as a quiz or code challenge)
- Four exercises as part of the Learn module
- One knowledge check quiz 

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

> Now you are ready to build out your lesson plan. Summarize the key learning events here by creating an outline of the milestones that you can lay out to structure the course.

1. List the key learning events in the workshop - for a one-hour workshop, we recommend 5 milestones
- Introduction
- Exercise - Prepare the project
- Use the Remote - Containers extension in Visual Studio Code
- Exercise - Add a dev container to an existing project
- Customize project and editor settings
- Exercise - Customize project and editor settings
- Add software to an existing container
- Exercise - Add software to an existing container
